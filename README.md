# 🧠 JARVIS - Virtual Assistant

**JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System)** is a voice-activated browser-based assistant built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Web Speech API to recognize user voice commands and respond via text-to-speech. It can perform web searches, tell the time and date, open popular websites, and even tell jokes — all hands-free!
